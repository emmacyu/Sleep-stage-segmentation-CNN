### Abstract
Sleep is crucial to human health and identification of sleep stages can be used as indicators for diagnosis of many sleep disorders. The traditional sleep stage classification that relies heavily on physiciansâ€™ inspection is expensive and error prone. To mitigate the bottleneck of manual sleep data analysis, this project presents a hybrid multi-head conventional neural networks (CNN) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) method to automatically classify the sleep stages based on single channel electroencephalograph (EEG) data which is in time series format. Three models are built step by step with the same parameters used for the common characteristics in each model. Here, loss and accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the neural network. The experimental results show that multi-head CNN model can achieve a good accuracy above 73.9% even with only 3 parallel heads and 2 fully connected layers. With only one additional LSTM layer stacked on top of multi-head CNN, the performance improved drastically from 73.9% to 82.143%.
